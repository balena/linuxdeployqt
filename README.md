# linuxdeployqt ("FREEDOM" version)

This is a fork of the project https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt with the difference that you're not obliged to use Ubuntu as a development host. Use whatever distribution you're used to, but _know what you're doing_.

I believe that it is the developer's responsibility to know what needs to be made to support multiple distributions using AppImage + linuxdeployqt, and *a tool is just a tool, after all*.

For a more complete background of why this change has been made, check the original [discussion thread](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/issues/340).

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute with code, comments, whatever you want and in the way you want, it's Open Source!

## Contact

Refer always to the original project https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt as they are the original authors.

If you don't agree that developers should know what they are doing, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ .
